***#Assessment-Task***

The Github repository Assessment-Task comprises of 4 parts:

-   Part1 final Rscript.R

-   Part2.R

-   Part1.rmd

-   Part2.rmd

-   Part 1.rmd file consists of a data set for gene expression which involves RNA sequencing count data for three samples of interest and growth data of 100 trees at two site: North east and South west region of years 2005,2010,2015 and 2020. This section demonstrates the steps involved in downloading and analysing the data in Rstudio.This .rmd file also showcases a histogram plot to demonstrate the observed data generated for gene expression, as well as a box plot to visualise the differences of mean growth rate at the two sites.

-   Part1 final Rscript.R includes the codes that have been used to formulate the Part1.rmd file .

-   Part2.rmd file comprises of coding DNA sequences for two organisms, E.coli and Saprospirales bacterium . This file demonstrates how to download the fasta file into R,read the fasta file from Ensembl bacteria, and analyse the sequence data for evaluation of nucleotide and amino acid frequency in Dna and Protein sequence respectively. Both of them being demonstrated of separate bar plots. These sequences are further used to evaluate the codon usuage bias between both the sequences and Protein sequence k-mer frequency profiling.

-   Part2.R includes the codes that have been used to formulate the Part2.rmd file .

#How to run this program?

The .rmd files and .R files can be run using the Rstudio.
